**PROJECT**
These scripts were used for the analyses described in the paper 'Functional connectivity is dominated by aperiodic, rather than oscillatory, coupling'. This project aims to evaluate the contribution of aperiodic activity in estimating 
functional connectivity. To address this, we tested whether and how aperiodic activity impacts the reconstruction of putative oscillatory functional networks in two independent human EEG databases (n = 59, n = 103) during resting-state. 

**SCRIPTS**
The compute_avg_mat.m script computes the epoch-averaged functional connectivity matrix for each subject and for each connectivity metric (PLV, ciPLV, wPLI, AEC and orthoAEC). This script is used for both approaches (classical pipeline and
our approach proposed in this paper). 

The make_mask_matrices.m script computes the matrix identifying functional connections between ROIs, based on aperiodicity -unbiased oscillations according to the specparam results. If an aperiodicity-unbiased oscillation between [1-45] Hz was 
reported by the specparam algorithm in ROIi and in ROIj, it implies the presence of unbiased oscillations in two regions of interest. The matrix is obtained for each subjetc and for each connectivity metric. Then, the script permits to
retain only functional connectivity results in ROIs exhibiting connections based on aperiodicity-unbiased oscillations. This script is used in our approach only. 

The threshold_fc_matrices.m script performs the proportional thresholding to retain the top 5% of the strongest connections. This script is used for both approaches.

The compute_graph_metric.m script computes some graph metrics commonly used to describe the topological graph properties of cortical networks: clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency and betweenness centrality. Graph 
metrics were computed using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (Rubinov et al., 2009). This script is used for both approaches.
